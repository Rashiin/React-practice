# React Form Practice

This project is a simple practice of creating a form using React. The form collects data from the user and displays it in the DOM.

## Project Overview

The form collects the following details from the user:

- Name
- Family Name
- Major
- Address
- Email

Once the form is submitted, the data is displayed on the page.

## Code Overview

The project is structured into two main components:

- `Header`: This component displays the form title and instructions to the user.
- `Form`: This component handles the form logic. It uses React's `useState` hook to manage the form data and submission status. It also includes the form fields and a submit button.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`. Then, start the project using `npm start`.
